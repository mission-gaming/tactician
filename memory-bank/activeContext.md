## Next Steps
**IMMEDIATE PRIORITY - Implementation Phase**:

1. **ðŸš¨ READY**: Begin refactoring implementation following detailed plan in refactoringPlan.md
2. **ðŸš¨ PHASE 1**: Enhance SchedulingContext with inherent multi-leg support
3. **ðŸš¨ PHASE 2**: Create new LegStrategy interface and integrate into RoundRobinScheduler
4. **ðŸš¨ PHASE 3**: Remove SupportsMultipleLegs trait and implement all-or-nothing generation

**Future Enhancements** (after refactoring):
1. **Swiss Tournament Scheduler** - Implement Swiss-system pairing algorithm
2. **Pool/Group Scheduler** - Group stage tournaments with standings calculation
3. **Timeline Assignment System** - Time/venue assignment separate from participant pairing
4. **Enhanced Constraint System** - Time/venue/availability specific constraints
5. **Schedule Optimization** - Post-generation quality improvements and conflict resolution

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Modern PHP 8.2+**: Readonly classes, constructor property promotion, strict typing throughout
- **Immutable Value Objects**: All DTOs are immutable for thread safety and predictability
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean contracts for schedulers (SchedulerInterface) and constraints (ConstraintInterface)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable scheduling algorithms with consistent interface
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent constraint configuration with ConstraintSet::create()
- **Circle Method Algorithm**: Proper round-robin implementation ensuring each participant plays all others exactly once
- **ðŸ†• MULTI-LEG FIRST PRINCIPLE**: Multi-leg tournaments are the default assumption, single-leg is special case where legs=1
- **ðŸ†• ALL-OR-NOTHING GENERATION**: No silent event skipping - complete schedule or clear failure with diagnostics
- **ðŸ†• INTEGRATED LEG GENERATION**: Legs generated during core algorithm, not as post-processing step

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive Pest test coverage for all components
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependencies, no static methods
- **Iterator/Countable**: Memory-efficient traversal of schedules and events
- **Advanced Constraint System**: Sophisticated constraint validation with incremental context building
- **Multi-Leg Constraint Continuity**: Constraints properly validated across tournament legs
- **Factory Pattern**: Constraint factory methods for common use cases (home/away, metadata patterns)
- **Deterministic Randomization**: Seeded randomization for reproducible results
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between scheduling logic and data structures

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Architecture Quality**: Current implementation follows excellent SOLID principles and modern PHP patterns
- **Algorithm Completeness**: Round-robin implementation handles edge cases (2, 3, 4+ participants, odd/even counts)
- **Advanced Constraint System**: Comprehensive constraint validation with time-based, positional, and metadata constraints
- **Multi-Leg Constraint Validation**: Sophisticated incremental context building ensures constraints work across tournament legs
- **Real-World Application**: Complex constraint scenarios validate tournament director requirements
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests verify mathematical correctness and constraint enforcement
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterator pattern allows efficient traversal of large schedules without loading all events into memory
- **Extensibility**: Current architecture provides solid foundation for additional tournament systems and constraint types
- **Schedule Validation Success**: Mathematical validation approach (expected vs actual events) proves highly effective
- **PHPStan Value**: Level 8 static analysis catches subtle type and documentation issues before they become problems
- **Exception Design**: Hierarchical exception structure with diagnostic capabilities provides excellent developer experience
- **CI Pipeline Value**: Comprehensive automated checking ensures production readiness and prevents regressions
- **Documentation Quality**: Proper @throws annotations and array type specifications crucial for maintainability
- **ðŸ†• CRITICAL FLAW IDENTIFIED**: Current multi-leg approach can silently skip events when constraints fail - fundamental reliability issue
- **ðŸ†• ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHT**: Multi-leg support should be core assumption, not bolt-on feature
- **ðŸ†• CONSTRAINT CONTEXT LEARNING**: Full multi-leg context needed during generation, not post-processing validation
- **ðŸ†• DIAGNOSTIC IMPORTANCE**: Detailed failure reporting crucial for tournament schedule reliability
- **ðŸ†• REFACTORING PLAN COMPLETE**: Comprehensive technical specification addresses all identified risks and problems
- **ðŸ†• IMPLEMENTATION READY**: Clear implementation sequence defined with architectural principles established
