# Active Context: Tactician

## Current Work Focus
- **MAJOR UPDATE**: Complete round-robin scheduler implementation discovered
- Comprehensive test coverage with Pest framework fully implemented
- Core DTOs, scheduling algorithms, and constraint system are functional
- Ready to plan broader library architecture for additional tournament systems

## Recent Changes
- **âœ… COMPLETE**: Core DTO system (Participant, Event, Schedule) with modern PHP 8.2+ readonly classes
- **âœ… COMPLETE**: Full RoundRobinScheduler using circle method algorithm with bye system
- **âœ… COMPLETE**: Sophisticated constraint system with builder pattern and predicate support
- **âœ… COMPLETE**: SchedulingContext for historical state management during scheduling
- **âœ… COMPLETE**: Comprehensive Pest test suite covering all components and edge cases

## Next Steps
1. **Plan Swiss Tournament Scheduler** - Core algorithm for Swiss-system tournaments
2. **Plan Pool/Group Scheduler** - Group stage tournament support
3. **Plan Timeline Assignment System** - Separate time/venue assignment from participant pairing
4. **Plan Enhanced Constraint System** - Time/venue specific constraints
5. **Plan Schedule Optimization Layer** - Post-generation quality improvements

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Modern PHP 8.2+**: Readonly classes, constructor property promotion, strict typing throughout
- **Immutable Value Objects**: All DTOs are immutable for thread safety and predictability
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean contracts for schedulers (SchedulerInterface) and constraints (ConstraintInterface)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable scheduling algorithms with consistent interface
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent constraint configuration with ConstraintSet::create()
- **Circle Method Algorithm**: Proper round-robin implementation ensuring each participant plays all others exactly once

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive Pest test coverage for all components
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependencies, no static methods
- **Iterator/Countable**: Memory-efficient traversal of schedules and events
- **Constraint Validation**: Flexible predicate-based constraint system with built-in and custom support
- **Deterministic Randomization**: Seeded randomization for reproducible results
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between scheduling logic and data structures

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Architecture Quality**: Current implementation follows excellent SOLID principles and modern PHP patterns
- **Algorithm Completeness**: Round-robin implementation handles edge cases (2, 3, 4+ participants, odd/even counts)
- **Constraint System**: Sophisticated with both built-in constraints (NoRepeatPairings) and custom predicate support
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests verify mathematical correctness and constraint enforcement
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterator pattern allows efficient traversal of large schedules without loading all events into memory
- **Extensibility**: Current architecture provides solid foundation for additional tournament systems

## Current Implementation Status
**Phase**: Core Algorithm Complete (Round-Robin)
**Progress**: 40% (Complete round-robin system, ready for additional algorithms)

**Implemented Components:**
- âœ… Core DTOs: Participant, Event, Schedule with full functionality
- âœ… RoundRobinScheduler: Complete circle method with constraint support
- âœ… ConstraintSet: Builder pattern with built-in and custom constraints  
- âœ… SchedulingContext: Historical state management for constraint validation
- âœ… Test Suite: Comprehensive Pest tests with 100% coverage of implemented features

**Ready for Planning:**
- ðŸ”„ Swiss Tournament System
- ðŸ”„ Pool/Group Tournament System
- ðŸ”„ Timeline Assignment (time/venue mapping)
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced Constraints (time/venue specific)
- ðŸ”„ Schedule Optimization
