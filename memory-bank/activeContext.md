# Active Context: Tactician

## Current Work Focus
- Composer package configuration and PHP project setup
- Establishing development toolchain and dependencies

## Recent Changes
- Created comprehensive composer.json file for the project
- Configured PHP 8.2+ requirements and development dependencies
- Set up PSR-4 autoloading for MissionGaming\Tactician namespace
- Added testing, static analysis, and code quality toolchain

## Next Steps
1. Initialize project structure (src/, tests/ directories)
2. Set up PHPStan, Rector, and PHP-CS-Fixer configuration files
3. Create initial core DTOs and interfaces
4. Begin implementing scheduling algorithms

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Chosen PHP 8.2+ as minimum version for modern language features
- Selected Pest as primary testing framework with PHPUnit fallback
- Established MissionGaming\Tactician as root namespace
- Configured comprehensive CI script for automated quality checks

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Test-driven development approach using Pest
- Strict static analysis with PHPStan
- Automated code modernization with Rector
- Consistent code style with PHP-CS-Fixer
- Composer scripts for developer workflow automation

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Project is a PHP library for tournament scheduling algorithms
- Supports Round Robin, Swiss, and Pool play scheduling
- Emphasizes deterministic algorithms with seeded randomness
- Separates fixture generation from timeline assignment
- Targets competitions up to ~50 participants for performance
