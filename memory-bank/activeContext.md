## Next Steps
1. **Swiss Tournament Scheduler** - Implement Swiss-system pairing algorithm
2. **Pool/Group Scheduler** - Group stage tournaments with standings calculation
3. **Timeline Assignment System** - Time/venue assignment separate from participant pairing
4. **Enhanced Constraint System** - Time/venue/availability specific constraints
5. **Schedule Optimization** - Post-generation quality improvements and conflict resolution

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- **Modern PHP 8.2+**: Readonly classes, constructor property promotion, strict typing throughout
- **Immutable Value Objects**: All DTOs are immutable for thread safety and predictability
- **Interface Segregation**: Clean contracts for schedulers (SchedulerInterface) and constraints (ConstraintInterface)
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable scheduling algorithms with consistent interface
- **Builder Pattern**: Fluent constraint configuration with ConstraintSet::create()
- **Circle Method Algorithm**: Proper round-robin implementation ensuring each participant plays all others exactly once

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive Pest test coverage for all components
- **Dependency Injection**: Constructor-based dependencies, no static methods
- **Iterator/Countable**: Memory-efficient traversal of schedules and events
- **Constraint Validation**: Flexible predicate-based constraint system with built-in and custom support
- **Deterministic Randomization**: Seeded randomization for reproducible results
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clean separation between scheduling logic and data structures

## Learnings and Project Insights
- **Architecture Quality**: Current implementation follows excellent SOLID principles and modern PHP patterns
- **Algorithm Completeness**: Round-robin implementation handles edge cases (2, 3, 4+ participants, odd/even counts)
- **Constraint System**: Sophisticated with both built-in constraints (NoRepeatPairings) and custom predicate support
- **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests verify mathematical correctness and constraint enforcement
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterator pattern allows efficient traversal of large schedules without loading all events into memory
- **Extensibility**: Current architecture provides solid foundation for additional tournament systems

## Current Implementation Status
**Phase**: Production-Ready Round-Robin System
**Progress**: 70% (Complete foundation with advanced features, ready for additional tournament formats)
