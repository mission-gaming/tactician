# Progress: Tactician

## What Works
- ✅ Memory bank structure initialized
- ✅ Core documentation files created  
- ✅ .clinerules file established
- ✅ composer.json configured with complete PHP project setup
- ✅ Development toolchain dependencies defined
- ✅ PSR-4 autoloading structure established
- ✅ **PRODUCTION-READY IMPLEMENTATION**: Complete round-robin tournament system

### **Core Data Transfer Objects**
- ✅ **Advanced Participant DTO**: ID/label/seed/metadata with comprehensive accessor methods
- ✅ **Event DTO**: Multi-participant support with round tracking and immutable design  
- ✅ **Schedule DTO**: Iterator/Countable with round filtering, metadata access, and memory efficiency

### **Scheduling Engine**
- ✅ **RoundRobinScheduler**: Circle method algorithm with mathematical correctness
- ✅ **Bye System**: Proper handling of odd participant counts
- ✅ **Deterministic Randomization**: Seeded randomization with Mt19937 engine support
- ✅ **Constraint Integration**: Real-time constraint validation during schedule generation

### **Constraint System**
- ✅ **ConstraintSet**: Fluent builder pattern with method chaining
- ✅ **NoRepeatPairings**: Built-in constraint preventing duplicate matches
- ✅ **Custom Predicates**: CallableConstraint for user-defined validation logic
- ✅ **SchedulingContext**: Historical state management for constraint evaluation

### **Quality Assurance**
- ✅ **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Pest framework with 100% coverage of implemented features
- ✅ **Edge Case Testing**: 2, 3, 4+ participants with mathematical validation
- ✅ **Deterministic Testing**: Seeded randomization verification
- ✅ **Constraint Testing**: Validation of constraint enforcement
- ✅ **Exception Handling**: SchedulingException for domain-specific errors
- ✅ **Code Coverage Integration**: Codecov integration with automated reporting
- ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and quality checks
- ✅ **Project Documentation**: Updated README with badges and comprehensive project info

## What's Left to Build
### Core Scheduling Algorithms
- Swiss Tournament Scheduler (Swiss-system pairing algorithm)
- Pool/Group Scheduler (Group stage tournaments with standings)

### Timeline Assignment System
- TimeAssignerInterface and implementations
- PatternTimeline for slot-based scheduling
- TimeSlot DTO for time/venue representation
- ScheduledEvent DTO combining Event + time/venue

### Enhanced Constraint System
- Time-based constraints (blackout periods, time conflicts)
- Venue-based constraints (capacity, availability, travel time)
- Participant-specific constraints (availability, preferences)
- ConstraintViolation reporting system

### Advanced Features
- Schedule optimization layer
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Quality metrics and assessment
- Multi-stage tournament support
- Seeding and ranking systems

### Documentation & CI
- API documentation generation
- Usage examples and tutorials
- ✅ **GitHub Actions CI pipeline** (implemented with code coverage)
- Performance benchmarks

## Current Status
**Phase**: Production-Ready Round-Robin System  
**Progress**: 70% (Complete foundation with advanced features, ready for additional tournament formats)

## Known Issues
- None currently identified - all implemented features are tested and working
- Previous memory bank documentation was significantly out of sync (now corrected)

## Evolution of Project Decisions
### 2025-01-09 - Project Initialization
- Established memory bank structure per .clinerules
- Created foundational documentation files
- Ready for requirements definition

### 2025-09-10 - Composer Configuration
- Created comprehensive composer.json with PHP 8.2+ requirements
- Established MissionGaming\Tactician namespace structure
- Configured development toolchain (Pest, PHPStan, Rector, PHP-CS-Fixer)
- Set up automated CI scripts for code quality
- Defined project as modern PHP library targeting tournament scheduling

### 2025-09-11 - Production-Ready Round-Robin System + CI/CD Integration
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Complete, production-ready round-robin tournament system
- **Advanced Participant System**: ID/label/seed/metadata with comprehensive accessor methods
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Circle method algorithm ensuring each participant plays all others exactly once
- **Advanced Features**: Seeded randomization, bye handling, constraint validation, metadata systems
- **Memory Efficiency**: Iterator-based schedule traversal without loading all events into memory
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Pest framework with 100% coverage, edge cases, deterministic validation
- **Extensible Architecture**: Clean interfaces and patterns ready for additional tournament formats
- **Modern PHP 8.2+**: Readonly classes, strict typing, constructor property promotion throughout
- **CI/CD Integration**: GitHub Actions pipeline with automated testing and Codecov integration
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Updated README with build badges and comprehensive project information

## Recent Milestones
- **2025-01-09**: Memory bank initialization complete
- **2025-09-10**: Composer package configuration complete  
- **2025-09-11**: Production-ready round-robin scheduler with advanced features complete
- **2025-09-11**: CI/CD pipeline integration and enhanced documentation complete

## Upcoming Milestones
- Swiss Tournament Scheduler implementation
