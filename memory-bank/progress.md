# Progress: Tactician

## What Works
- ✅ Memory bank structure initialized
- ✅ Core documentation files created
- ✅ .clinerules file established
- ✅ composer.json configured with complete PHP project setup
- ✅ Development toolchain dependencies defined
- ✅ PSR-4 autoloading structure established

## What's Left to Build
- Project directory structure (src/, tests/)
- Configuration files (phpstan.neon, rector.php, .php-cs-fixer.php)
