# Progress: Tactician

## What Works
- ✅ Memory bank structure initialized
- ✅ Core documentation files created
- ✅ .clinerules file established
- ✅ composer.json configured with complete PHP project setup
- ✅ Development toolchain dependencies defined
- ✅ PSR-4 autoloading structure established
- ✅ **COMPLETE PROJECT STRUCTURE**: Full src/ and tests/ directory implementation
- ✅ **CORE DTOS**: Participant, Event, Schedule with modern PHP 8.2+ readonly classes
- ✅ **ROUND-ROBIN SCHEDULER**: Complete circle method algorithm with constraint support
- ✅ **CONSTRAINT SYSTEM**: ConstraintSet with builder pattern, built-in and custom predicates
- ✅ **SCHEDULING CONTEXT**: Historical state management for constraint validation
- ✅ **COMPREHENSIVE TEST SUITE**: Pest framework with full coverage of implemented features
- ✅ **EXCEPTION HANDLING**: SchedulingException for error management

## What's Left to Build
### Core Scheduling Algorithms
- Swiss Tournament Scheduler (Swiss-system pairing algorithm)
- Pool/Group Scheduler (Group stage tournaments with standings)

### Timeline Assignment System
- TimeAssignerInterface and implementations
- PatternTimeline for slot-based scheduling
- TimeSlot DTO for time/venue representation
- ScheduledEvent DTO combining Event + time/venue

### Enhanced Constraint System
- Time-based constraints (blackout periods, time conflicts)
- Venue-based constraints (capacity, availability, travel time)
- Participant-specific constraints (availability, preferences)
- ConstraintViolation reporting system

### Advanced Features
- Schedule optimization layer
- Conflict resolution algorithms
- Quality metrics and assessment
- Multi-stage tournament support
- Seeding and ranking systems

### Documentation & CI
- API documentation generation
- Usage examples and tutorials
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- Performance benchmarks

## Current Status
**Phase**: Core Algorithm Complete (Round-Robin)  
**Progress**: 40% (Solid foundation with complete round-robin system)

## Known Issues
- Test configuration may need adjustment for CI environment
- Memory bank documentation was out of sync with actual implementation

## Evolution of Project Decisions
### 2025-01-09 - Project Initialization
- Established memory bank structure per .clinerules
- Created foundational documentation files
- Ready for requirements definition

### 2025-09-10 - Composer Configuration
- Created comprehensive composer.json with PHP 8.2+ requirements
- Established MissionGaming\Tactician namespace structure
- Configured development toolchain (Pest, PHPStan, Rector, PHP-CS-Fixer)
- Set up automated CI scripts for code quality
- Defined project as modern PHP library targeting tournament scheduling

### 2025-10-09 - Complete Round-Robin Implementation
- **MAJOR MILESTONE**: Full round-robin scheduler with circle method algorithm
- Comprehensive DTO system: Participant, Event, Schedule with immutable design
- Sophisticated constraint system with builder pattern and predicate support
- Complete test suite with Pest framework covering edge cases and mathematical correctness
- Modern PHP 8.2+ architecture with readonly classes and strict typing
- Memory-efficient Iterator/Countable implementations
- Deterministic randomization support with seeded Randomizer
- Foundation established for additional tournament algorithms

## Recent Milestones
- **2025-01-09**: Memory bank initialization complete
- **2025-09-10**: Composer package configuration complete
- **2025-10-09**: Complete round-robin scheduler implementation with tests

## Upcoming Milestones
- Swiss Tournament Scheduler implementation
- Timeline assignment system development
- Pool/Group scheduler with standings calculation
- Enhanced constraint system with time/venue support
- Schedule optimization and quality assessment features
