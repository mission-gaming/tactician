# Product Context: Tactician

## Why This Project Exists

Tactician addresses the complexity of tournament scheduling in competitive gaming and sports. Tournament organizers need reliable, deterministic algorithms to create fair, balanced schedules that follow sport-specific rules and constraints. Existing solutions are often either too simple (basic round-robin without constraints) or too complex (enterprise tournament management systems with unnecessary overhead).

The library bridges this gap by providing a modern PHP implementation focused specifically on the algorithmic scheduling layer, allowing developers to build tournament applications with solid mathematical foundations.

## Problems It Solves

### **1. Deterministic Tournament Scheduling**
- Ensures reproducible results with seeded randomization
- Guarantees each participant plays every other participant exactly once (Round Robin)
- Handles edge cases like odd participant counts with proper bye management

### **2. Flexible Constraint System**
- Built-in constraints like "no repeat pairings" 
- Custom predicate-based constraints for sport-specific rules
- Historical context awareness for constraint validation
- Composable constraint sets with builder pattern

### **3. Algorithm Correctness**
- Mathematically sound circle method for round-robin generation
- Proper handling of 2, 3, 4+ participant scenarios
- Memory-efficient iteration without loading entire schedules
- Separation of pairing logic from time/venue assignment

### **4. Modern PHP Development**
- PHP 8.2+ with readonly classes and strict typing
- Immutable value objects for thread safety
- Clean interfaces for algorithm extensibility
- Comprehensive test coverage for reliability

## How It Should Work

### **Core Workflow**
```php
// Create participants
$participants = [
    new Participant('Player 1'),
    new Participant('Player 2'),
    new Participant('Player 3'),
    new Participant('Player 4'),
];

// Configure constraints
$constraints = ConstraintSet::create()
    ->withNoRepeatPairings()
    ->withCustom(fn($event, $context) => /* custom logic */);

// Generate schedule
$scheduler = new RoundRobinScheduler($constraints);
$schedule = $scheduler->schedule($participants);

// Iterate through matches
foreach ($schedule as $event) {
    echo "Round {$event->round}: {$event->participants[0]->name} vs {$event->participants[1]->name}\n";
}
```

### **Key Principles**
- **Immutability**: All DTOs are readonly and return new instances
- **Composability**: Constraints and schedulers can be combined flexibly  
- **Performance**: Iterator pattern enables efficient memory usage
- **Determinism**: Seeded randomization produces reproducible results
- **Extensibility**: Clean interfaces for adding new algorithms
