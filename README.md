# Tactician

A modern PHP library for solving tournament scheduling problems with reliable, mathematically-sound algorithms. Generate fair, balanced tournament schedules for round-robin leagues, Swiss-style tournaments, and group-based competitions‚Äîall in pure PHP.

## Overview

**Tournament scheduling is harder than it looks.** Creating fair, balanced tournaments that ensure every participant gets equal opportunities while respecting constraints (like "no team plays twice in a row" or "avoid repeat matchups") quickly becomes a complex mathematical problem. Unlike other languages that have mature constraint programming libraries and scheduling engines, PHP has been left behind - existing solutions are either unmaintained, limited to basic round-robin only, or built with outdated practices.

**Tactician fills that gap.** Built from the ground up with modern PHP practices, Tactician provides battle-tested algorithms for Round Robin (every participant plays every other participant exactly once), Swiss System (participants paired based on performance after each round), and Pool/Group Play (divide participants into groups with standings). It uses *deterministic* algorithms (meaning the same input always produces the same schedule) with mathematical guarantees of fairness, designed for small to medium tournaments (up to ~50 participants) where you need reliable scheduling without enterprise complexity. For larger tournaments or advanced constraint optimization, consider dedicated scheduling engines.

**Key Features:**
- üèÜ **Deterministic Algorithms**: Round Robin (complete), Swiss and Pool play (coming soon)
- üîß **Flexible Constraints**: Built-in and custom predicate-based constraint system
- ‚ö° **Memory Efficient**: Generator-based iteration for large tournaments
- üéØ **Modern PHP**: PHP 8.2+ with readonly classes and strict typing
- üß™ **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite with Pest framework
- üìê **Mathematical Accuracy**: Circle method implementation for round-robin

## Installation

Install via Composer:

```bash
composer require mission-gaming/tactician
```

**Requirements:**
- PHP 8.2+
- No external dependencies in production

## Quick Start

```php
<?php

use MissionGaming\Tactician\DTO\Participant;
use MissionGaming\Tactician\Scheduling\RoundRobinScheduler;
use MissionGaming\Tactician\Constraints\ConstraintSet;

// Create participants
$participants = [
    new Participant('celtic', 'Celtic'),
    new Participant('athletic', 'Athletic Bilbao'),
    new Participant('livorno', 'AS Livorno'),
    new Participant('redstar', 'Red Star FC'),
];

// Configure constraints
$constraints = ConstraintSet::create()
    ->noRepeatPairings()
    ->build();

// Generate schedule
$scheduler = new RoundRobinScheduler($constraints);
$schedule = $scheduler->schedule($participants);

// Iterate through matches
foreach ($schedule as $event) {
    echo "Round {$event->getRound()}: ";
    echo "{$event->getParticipants()[0]->getLabel()} vs {$event->getParticipants()[1]->getLabel()}\n";
}
```

## Core Concepts

### Participants and Events

```php
// Create participants with unique identifiers
$player1 = new Participant('celtic', 'Celtic', 1, ['city' => 'Glasgow']);
$player2 = new Participant('athletic', 'Athletic Bilbao', 2, ['city' => 'Bilbao']);

// Events represent matches/games between participants
$event = new Event(
    participants: [$player1, $player2],
    round: 1,
    metadata: ['court' => 'A', 'time' => '10:00']
);
```

### Constraint System

```php
// Built-in constraints
$constraints = ConstraintSet::create()
    ->noRepeatPairings()
    ->custom(fn($event, $context) => 
        // Custom constraint logic
        !$this->participantHasConflict($event->getParticipants()[0], $context)
    )
    ->build();

// Use constraints in scheduler
$scheduler = new RoundRobinScheduler($constraints);
```

### Scheduling Context

The library maintains historical context for constraint validation:

```php
// Context tracks previous events for constraint checking
$context = new SchedulingContext();
$context->addEvent($previousEvent);

// Constraints can access this history
$isValid = $constraints->isSatisfied($newEvent, $context);
```

## Available Algorithms

### ‚úÖ Round Robin (Complete)
Perfect for leagues where every participant plays every other participant exactly once.

```php
$scheduler = new RoundRobinScheduler($constraints);
$schedule = $scheduler->schedule($participants);

// Handles edge cases:
// - 2 participants: 1 round, 1 match
// - 3 participants: 3 rounds, 3 matches (with byes)
// - 4+ participants: n-1 rounds using circle method
```

### üîÑ Swiss System (Coming Soon)
Ideal for tournaments where participants are paired based on performance.

### üîÑ Pool/Group Play (Coming Soon)
Perfect for group stages with standings and advancement rules.

## Development

./vendor/bin/pest tests/Unit/RoundRobinSchedulerTest.php
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **DTOs**: Immutable value objects (`Participant`, `Event`, `Schedule`)
- **Schedulers**: Algorithm implementations (`RoundRobinScheduler`)
- **Constraints**: Flexible predicate system (`ConstraintSet`, `NoRepeatPairings`)
- **Context**: Historical state management (`SchedulingContext`)

### Design Principles

- **Immutability**: All DTOs are readonly and return new instances
- **Composability**: Constraints and schedulers combine flexibly
- **Performance**: Iterator pattern enables efficient memory usage
- **Determinism**: Seeded randomization produces reproducible results
- **Extensibility**: Clean interfaces for adding new algorithms

## About Mission Gaming

**[Mission Gaming](https://missiongaming.gg)** is an esports organization that runs competitive tournaments for EAFC Clubs (11v11 virtual football). Founded and operated by software engineers who are passionate about both competitive gaming and building exceptional technology, we created Tactician to solve our own scheduling challenges on our **Metronome** tournament platform.

After struggling with unmaintained libraries and limited PHP scheduling options, we decided to build the tournament scheduling solution we wished existed‚Äîthen open source it for the community. We're expanding to other games and building what we believe will be the premier esports tournament platform.
